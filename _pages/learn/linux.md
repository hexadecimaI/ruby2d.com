# Install Ruby

Installing Ruby with package managers (e.g. apt, yum, pacman) can cause issues. We recommend using a Ruby version manager instead, like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). Here's how to set it up:

1. In your terminal, clone the rbenv repo into `~/.rbenv`:
```
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
```

2. Install [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) as an rbenv plugin, which will add the `rbenv install` command:
```
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
```

3. Add rbenv to your path and initialize it by adding the following to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

4. Get access to rbenv by loading the new shell config using:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or `~/.bash_profile`
```

5. [Install packages](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build/wiki#suggested-build-environment) to prepare your build environment.

6. Install the latest version of Ruby (3.0.1 in this case) and set it as the global default:
```
rbenv install 3.0.1
rbenv global 3.0.1
```

7. Check to make sure everything works (the `$` symbol represents the prompt):
```
$ rbenv versions
  system
* 3.0.1 (set by /home/<me>/.rbenv/version)
$ ruby -e "puts 'Hello Ruby'"
Hello Ruby
```

# Install packages

Ruby 2D needs a few packages to tap into low-level graphics and hardware. Install the following for your Linux distribution.

**Ubuntu, Debian, and Mint**
```
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

**CentOS and Fedora**
```
sudo yum install SDL2-devel SDL2_image-devel SDL2_mixer-devel SDL2_ttf-devel
```

**openSUSE**
```
sudo zypper install libSDL2-devel libSDL2_image-devel libSDL2_mixer-devel libSDL2_ttf-devel
```

**Arch**
```
sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf
```

That's it! Head back to the "get started" guide and [write your first 2D app Â»](/learn/get-started)
